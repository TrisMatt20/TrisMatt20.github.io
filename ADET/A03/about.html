                    This timeless quote isn't just for Spider-Man — <i>it reflects a universal truth about life.</i>
                    Every
                    skill we learn, every talent we develop, and every role we take on gives us a form of power. Whether
                    it's coding a system that people will rely on, sharing knowledge, or even just being a good friend —
                    we all hold some kind of influence. <br><br>

                    In human life, especially in tech and leadership, our <b>"powers"</b> aren't webs or super strength.
                    <i>They're our decisions, our actions, and how we choose to use our abilities. </i>Responsibility
                    means not
                    just doing what's expected, but also doing what's right — even when no one's watching. <br><br>

                    For me, this quote is a reminder to stay grounded as I grow — in tech, in life, and in purpose.
                    <i>Because the more I learn, the more I owe it to myself and to others to use that knowledge
                        wisely.</i>
                </p>

                <p class="message p-4 text-start animate-up">
                    This website was personally designed by me for academic purposes. As a tribute to the legacy of
                    Spider-Man and my love for the character, I created this project using the skills I have learned
                    from Web Development. While it may not feature every possible layout or functionality, I focused on
                    delivering a clean and simple design that showcases Spider-Man's iconic suits in a Bento-style
                    format. This project serves as both a learning milestone and a creative expression of my passion for
                    web development and the Spider-Man universe.
