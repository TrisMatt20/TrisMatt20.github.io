    <p class="about px-4 mt-4 animate-up" style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 16px;">BINI, the sensational Filipino pop
        group, is made up
        of eight incredibly talented members: Aiah, Colet, Maloi, Gwen,
        Stacey, Mikha, Jhoanna, and Sheena. They have quickly risen to fame, becoming the most successful female
        Filipino
        act
        in history and the second biggest artist overall in the country. Their chart-topping hits “Salamin,
        Salamin” and
        “Pantropiko” held both the #1 and #2 spots on the top Filipino music charts at the same time. <br><br>
        Blending local
        influences with global pop inspirations, BINI's unique sound has captivated millions. With over 30
        million streams
        and explosive growth on social media, they recently made waves by selling out their “BINIverse” tour in
        record time.
        Their impact has not gone unnoticed — Teen Vogue named them one of 2024's girl groups to watch!</p>
