<p class="mensahe text-start px-3 mt-3 animate-up-asynch">This website was personally designed by me for academic purposes. As a show of
    appreciation and support for BINI, I created this platform using the skills I have learned from Web Development and
    PHP. While it may not have every feature, I focused on fulfilling the requirements set by our instructor while still
    adding a personal creative touch. This project serves as both a learning milestone and a tribute to the music and
    inspiration BINI brings to fans like me. </p>
<p class="mensahe text-start px-3 mt-3 animate-up-asynch">BINI is more than just a talented girl group, they are a symbol of empowerment,
    grace, and determination. Through their music, performances, and advocacy, they inspire people to dream big, work
    hard, and stay true to themselves. Their journey proves that with passion and perseverance, success is possible. For
    many fans, including myself, they are not just idols on stage, but real-life role models who continue to make a
    difference in the lives of others.</p>
