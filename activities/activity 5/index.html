        Dubai is a destination located in United Arab Emirates that mixes modern culture with history, adventure with
        world-class shopping and entertainment. <br><br>
        Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major transport hub for
        passengers and cargo. The emirate's Western-style model of
        business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial
        services. <br><br> Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). <br><br>
        Also, Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and
        sports events. The
        city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the world's tallest building,
        the Burj Khalifa.

    <h3 class="facts">
        Facts about Dubai
    </h3>
    <div class="factsInfo">
        <b>Currency:</b> UAE dirham. US$ 1 = AED 3.67. <br><br>
        <b>Time</b>: GMT + 4. Electricity: 220/240 v; sockets are three pin. <br><br>
        <b>Weather:</b> Temperatures range from a nightime low of around 10°C in winter (Dec-Mar), to a daytime high of
        49°C at the
        height of summer (Jun-Aug). The best time to visit is from October to April, with perfect temperatures for long,
        comfortable days at the beach and balmy evenings outside. <br><br>
        <b>Vaccinations:</b> No special injections are needed. <br><br>
        <b>Visas:</b> Citizens from the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and most Western European and Far Eastern
        countries are
        entitled to a free, 30-day extendable visit visa on arrival. Others must obtain a visa through a local sponsor
        or hotel. <br><br>
        <b>Duty Free:</b> There is a useful Duty Free shop by the baggage reclaim belts in the airport. The incoming
        allowance is 400 cigarettes or 250 grams cigars, 200ml perfume and four litres of wine or spirits. <br><br>
        <b>Clothing:</b> Loose-fitting cottons suit the year-round sunny climate best, with hats for the heat of the
        day.
        Winter evenings can be surprisingly cool, and it is best to come equipped for ferocious air conditioning.
        Although Dubai is
        generally permissive, you should dress modestly when around town, and long skirts or trousers and short sleeves
        are a must when venturing further afield, especially during Ramadan. <br><br>
        <b>Safety:</b> The fact is, Dubai is one of the safest cities in the world, with very low crime rates meaning
        travelling around the city is very safe. That said, Dubai is a big world city and common sense precautions
        should be observed. <br><br>
        Women should have little trouble exploring the city alone. However, a modest sense of dress will ensure less
        unwanted attention in the more traditional parts of the city.
