                Dubai is a destination located in United Arab Emirates that mixes modern culture with history, adventure
                with
                world-class shopping and entertainment. <br><br>
                Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major transport hub
                for
                passengers and cargo. The emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main
                revenues now coming from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. <br><br> Dubai is the
                most
                populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). <br><br>
                Also, Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects
                and
                sports events. The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the
                world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.

            <p>
                Ever since I was a kid, It is my dream to travel to different countries around the world. Dubai is one
                of my
                dream countries to visit one day. I have some family relatives who lived there and I want to see what's
                in
                Dubai and what Dubai has to offer for its tourists. <br><br>
                I want to explore Dubai's tourist spots including the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, the
                world's largest mall, the Dubai Mall, and many more. I also want to try their cuisine and other foods
                such
                as the Biryani.

        <h3 class="facts text-center py-3" style="font-weight: bold;">Facts about Dubai</h3>
        <div class="factsInfo container my-4">
            <p>
                <b>Currency:</b> UAE dirham. US$ 1 = AED 3.67. <br><br>
                <b>Time</b>: GMT + 4. Electricity: 220/240 v; sockets are three pin. <br><br>
                <b>Weather:</b> Temperatures range from a nightime low of around 10°C in winter (Dec-Mar), to a daytime
                high
                of 49°C at the height of summer (Jun-Aug). The best time to visit is from October to April, with perfect
                temperatures for long, comfortable days at the beach and balmy evenings outside. <br><br>
                <b>Vaccinations:</b> No special injections are needed. <br><br>
                <b>Visas:</b> Citizens from the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and most Western European and Far
                Eastern
                countries are entitled to a free, 30-day extendable visit visa on arrival. Others must obtain a visa
                through
                a local sponsor or hotel. <br><br>
                <b>Duty Free:</b> There is a useful Duty Free shop by the baggage reclaim belts in the airport. The
                incoming
                allowance is 400 cigarettes or 250 grams cigars, 200ml perfume and four litres of wine or spirits.
                <br><br>
                <b>Clothing:</b> Loose-fitting cottons suit the year-round sunny climate best, with hats for the heat of
                the
                day. Winter evenings can be surprisingly cool, and it is best to come equipped for ferocious air
                conditioning. Although Dubai is generally permissive, you should dress modestly when around town, and
                long
                skirts or trousers and short sleeves are a must when venturing further afield, especially during
                Ramadan.
                <br><br>
                <b>Safety:</b> The fact is, Dubai is one of the safest cities in the world, with very low crime rates
                meaning travelling around the city is very safe. That said, Dubai is a big world city and common sense
                precautions should be observed. Women should have little trouble exploring the city alone. However, a
                modest
                sense of dress will ensure less unwanted attention in the more traditional parts of the city.
