						the Searcher until it was contained within the Orb and hidden for millennia on
						a Morag temple. <br><br>
						The Orb containing the Power Stone was coveted by Thanos, who employed the Kree warrior Ronan
						the Accuser in 2014 to retrieve it for him. However, before Ronan could acquire the Orb, it was
						stolen by Star-Lord, prompting a galaxy-wide hunt that resulted in the Orb being given to
						the Nova Corps for safe-keeping. Thanos later retrieved the Power Stone from the Nova Corps
						in 2018 and inserted it into his Infinity Gauntlet, using it in conjunction with the other five
						stones to eliminate half of all life in the universe. Following the completion of his life's
						goal, Thanos destroyed all six stones to prevent his work from being undone.
